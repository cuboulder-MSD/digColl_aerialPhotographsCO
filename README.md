# Aerial Photographs of Colorado
## Description
Aerial Photographs of Colorado collection metadata from the University of Colorado Boulder. 

Aerial photographs dramatically portray the changing landscape of Colorado: a mountain valley can be seen where there is now a reservoir; changes in the vegetation and ground cover can be traced over the years, and the growth of towns and cities documented. This collection provides access to more than 2,800 aerial photographs of Colorado taken by the U.S. Forest Service, Soil Conservation Service, and Agricultural Adjustment Administration from 1936 to 1947. Each photograph is identified by a project or county code followed by the roll and frame numbers assigned by the photographing agency.

## Metadata

Metadata fields for the Aerial Photographs of Colorado collection:

# Project-Roll-Frame
The photograph sequence number. The project designation (2-3 letter code); film roll number; frame number.

# Date
Dates are transcribed from the photograph, and reformatted to conform to ISO standards 
Datasets prior to 2020-07 will have the dates transcribed verbatim from the photographs, usually in MM/DD/YYYY format.

# Publisher
Publisher of the photographs. This is the agency that requisitioned the flights for a particular area. Derived from stamps on the back of the runs of photographs.

# Scale
Scale of the photographs. Generally 1:20,000.

# sortOrder
Older field no longer in use.

# County
Counties the image covers. If multiple counties are pictured in the photograph, they are listed in repeated County columns.

# State
States the image covers. If multiple states are pictured in the photograph, they are listed in repeated State columns.

# 1:24000 USGS Topo Quad Name
The 1:240000 scale topographic map that the centerpoint sits inside. 

# 1:24000 USGS Topo Quad Name Authority
Origin of the map listed, generally USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).

# Landmark
Derived from the GNIS list of landmarks. Natural or permanent features are prioritized. Some non-permanent feature classes, mostly buildings, locales, or census areas are not used except under special circumstances. 

# Landmark Authority
Origin of the Landmark listed, generally USGS Geographic Names Information System (GNIS).

# Center Point Latitude
Latitude of the center point of the photograph.

# Center Point Longitude
Longitude of the center point of the photograph.

# Physical Item Location
Location of the physical photograph where it is stored at the University of Colorado Boulder.

# Rights
After 2020-07: statements are from Rightsstatements.org. These are in the same spirit as the earlier statements.

## Notes
Project-Roll-Frame numbers on the images:
The older (1930s, 1940s) images typically have a handwritten date in one corner, and a code in the other corner.  The code can denote multiple things:

County: the letter code can possibly designate a county.
https://www.fsa.usda.gov/Internet/FSA_File/catalogpdf.pdf  - list of counties and projects from the FDA - county codes are in parentheses next to the county name.  
The county code was used for the Colorado Springs Aerial Photographs - YL denotes El Paso County, and the series number and sequence is stamped next to it.  
Sometimes the code (BOW, BOV) is used to note the flight number, or some kind of information about the company doing the flight.  In this case, some digging through archived government records may be necessary, as direct references to precisely what this number means are lacking online.  

Fun fact:
In some of the photos, what looks like topographical lines can be seen on the landscape.  These are plow lines that were done by the Soil Conservation Service in the 1920s to help mitigate soil movement due to overuse (the "Dust Bowl") or lack of vegetation in general to hold the soil in place.  These lines can still be seen in some undeveloped areas (notably east of Fountain, CO) in modern satellite imagery.  

Items are held by the Jerry Crail Johnson Earth Sciences & Map Library at the University of Colorado Boulder.
